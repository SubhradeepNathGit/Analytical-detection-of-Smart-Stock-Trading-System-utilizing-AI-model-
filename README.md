# Analytical Detection of Smart Stock Trading System Utilizing AI Models

## Overview

This project aims to develop a smart stock trading system by leveraging advanced AI models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to create a system capable of analyzing historical stock market data, predicting future stock prices, and providing actionable insights for traders. The repository includes all necessary files for training, deploying, and interacting with the AI model.

## Repository Structure

- **LSTM Model.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the LSTM model used for predicting stock prices. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation steps.

- **app.py**: A Python script that serves as the backend for the application. It handles data input, model inference, and provides an interface for users to interact with the AI models via a web or command-line interface.

- **keras_model.h5**: The pre-trained LSTM model saved in Keras' HDF5 format. This file can be loaded directly to make predictions without retraining the model.

- **model.pkl**: A serialized Python object containing the trained model, saved using the `pickle` module. This file is useful for quick deployment and integration into other Python-based systems.

- **tempCodeRunnerFile.py**: A temporary file generated during the development process, containing snippets of code used for testing and debugging.

- **README.md**: This documentation file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and usage details.

## Features

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Utilizes an LSTM network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) ideal for time-series data, to forecast future stock prices based on historical market data.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The `app.py` script provides a simple interface for users to input data and receive predictions, making the model accessible even to those with limited programming knowledge.

- **Model Deployment**: The trained model is provided in both `.h5` and `.pkl` formats, allowing for easy deployment in various environments.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhradeepNathGit/Analytical-detection-of-Smart-Stock-Trading-System-utilizing-AI-model-.git
   cd Analytical-detection-of-Smart-Stock-Trading-System-utilizing-AI-model-
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```


Model Training: The LSTM Model.ipynb notebook can be used to train the LSTM model on your custom dataset. Ensure that your data is properly formatted and run the notebook cells to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

Model Inference: Use the app.py script to get predictions from the pre-trained model. You can input new stock data, and the model will output predictions based on the trained LSTM network.
